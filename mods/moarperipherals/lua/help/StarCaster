StarCaster randomly generates fireworks based on the parameters you supply and the inventory you've loaded into the fireworks launcher.  StarCaster recognizes creative launchers and responds accordingly - no need for any ingredients.

Basic help can be found by pressing F1 or right clicking on the less 'obvious' elements of the main screen.

Logs are avaible for all shows in a session and may be viewed by clicking the button at the top, left of the main screen.  Logs are not written to disk.

StarCaster will use pre-loaded stars and fireworks before generating its own, however StarCaster will not automatically load any stars or fireworks that are in inventory.  This *may* change in the future.

StarCaster generates a single firework, then launches it, and repeates this process for the entire show - canceling a show early should not result in lost materials or firework rockets/stars that need to be unloaded from the launcher's buffer.

Command line options:

StarCaster [debug] [fast] [fancy] [splash]

debug = automatically start a firework show in debug mode, then exit when done - no UI

fast = start StarCaster with 'Quick' launch timing enabled

fancy = start StarCaster with 'Fancy' show type selected.

splash = start StarCaster with a splash screen - if you really like splash screens
